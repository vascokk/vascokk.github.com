A Word From The Author
------------------------

Hello all! 

This is the second attempt to start a blog. This time my intention is to create a 'working blog'. Here I am going to write about the new stuff I'm learning in programming and the reason to start is because trying to explain something is the best way to learn. To quote [Eric Lippert](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/):

{%blockquote%}
Writing a blog is also tremendously helpful; by requiring me to explain complex topics to other people, I am forced to confront my own inadequate understanding of various topics all the time.
