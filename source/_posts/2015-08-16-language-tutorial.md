## Writing a computer language - tutorial for the mere mortals.

Writing a computer language is cool and can make you famouse - everybody in the IT industry knows who Dennis Ritchie, James Gosling and Guido van Rossum are. Ever wondered what it takes to create a new language? You probably think that it needs a serious theoretical background and you must be a computer scientist to do this. Well, that's true. However, sometimes you need a tool simplier than a full-blown language, something that has just the right subset of features to acomplish some task. Here comes the Domain Specific Language. DSL's come in many different shapes. It could look like a language (e.g SQL), or a special XML schema (e.g. XSLT), or an API like: 

``` java
DataSet<Tuple2<String, Integer>>  wordCounts = text
            .flatMap(new LineSplitter())
            .groupBy(0)
            .sum(1);
```

In case you need something that looks more like a language than an XML or API, the good news is that you don't need to take (again?) a course in compilers and formal languages theory. There are tools, that implement all the "science" for you - lexers, parser generators, or also called "compiler-compiler" tools. Here is a list from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators#Deterministic_context-free_languages). 
As you can see - almost every major programming language has tools you can yous to create your own "language". I'll use my favorite Erlang for this tutorial, but the principles are the same for any other language.

## Basics

Here is how it works:

Sterp 1:

Step 2:

![LangTutorial2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/source/_posts/LangTutorial2.png)

In step 1 you are using an "alphabet" (specification of the allowed caracters and primitives) and a "grammer" (rules for building sentences in your language) to describe the language. Those two are used as an input to the lexical tools - in our case _leex_ and _yecc_. 
The _leex_ tool is called "lexer", "tokenizer" or "scanner". It will produce Erlang code specific to your "alphabet", which is used to convert the source text into valid language primitives - reserved words, strings, operators, delimiters, atoms (in case of Erlang), etc.
_yeec_ is called "compiler-compiler" or "parser-generator". It will produce Erlang code specific to your "grammar", which is used to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 

This step is executed only once.

The second step you will execute for each new DSL code you want to execute.
In this step basically you will use the Erlang code generated by _leex/yecc_ to convert your DSL source into AST and then evaluate the AST to produce results from a given input.
In simple words, an AST is a structure representing your custom language source code in such a way, that you can use to produce the result. There are two ways you can use the AST, i.e. there are 2 types of AST "Tree Parsers":
- you evaluate the tree for every input, or
- you generate a source/binary code based on the AST and execute this code for every input

Yes, the first one is caled "interpretation", and the second is "compilation", respectively your "Tree Parser" is either interpreter or compiler.

## Example DSL

Let say we want to create a DSL for arithmetic calculation with addition to some statistical functions, e.g.:
```
(3 + 5) * 12;
```
```
std(2,4,3,5,6,7,4,4,2,1);
```
```
mean(2,4,3,5,6,7,4,4,2,1)
```
For simplicity, the calculator will operate with integer numbers only.

## The tokenizer 
The building blocks of our DSL will be:
- digits: 0-9,
- operators: +, -, *, /,
- brackets: (),
- intervals (whitespaces),
- reserved words: sum, mean, std

A _leex_ definition file has a specific format:

```
<Header>

Definitions.

<Macro Definitions>

Rules.

<Token Rules>

Erlang code.

<Erlang code>
```
The mandatory parts are _Definitions_, _Rules_ and _Erlang code_.
_Definitions_ describes the allowed characters - the "alphabet".
_Rules_ - set of regular expressions to match larger primitives (e.g. reserved words) and escape sequences.
_Erlang code_ - defines erlang functions, which can be used in _Definitions_ and _Rules_

Here is the file for our calculator:

``` erlang
Definitions.

%digits
D = [0-9]

%lower-case letters
L = [a-z]

%whitespace
WS = \s    

Rules.

%integer numbers
{D}+ : {token,{number,TokenLine,list_to_integer(TokenChars)}}.

%functions(e.g. "sum", "mean", etc.)
{L}+ : Function = list_to_atom(TokenChars),
			{token,case reserved_word(Function) of
				   true -> case Function of
					       'end' -> {end_token,{'end',TokenLine}};
					       _ -> {Function, TokenLine}
					   end;
				   false -> {function,TokenLine,Function}
			       end}.

%operators
\+		:	{token,{'+',TokenLine}}.
\-		:	{token,{'-',TokenLine}}.
\*		:	{token,{'*',TokenLine}}.
\/		:	{token,{'/',TokenLine}}.

%brackets
\(		:	{token,{'(',TokenLine}}.
\)		:	{token,{')',TokenLine}}.

%whitespaces
{WS}+		:	skip_token.

%terminal simbol
\;		:	{end_token,{semicolon,TokenLine}}.

Erlang code.
-export([reserved_word/1]).
reserved_word('sum') -> true;
reserved_word('std') -> true;
reserved_word('mean') -> true.
```

The characters allowed in our DSL code are:
- digits
